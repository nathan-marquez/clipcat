And we're gonna spend\nthe night in all of them starting with the world's cheapest hotel all the way in India. Basically, you can rent\nthese mats for $1 a night. So, I'm gonna give you guys a room tour. See this mat right here? This is my entire room for the night. Oh! It's just like my mattress at home, minus the comfort. So what's the room service",

While we were trying to sleep, people kept stepping over us\nin the middle of the night. - Hey\n- Hey. - If you didn't believe\nwe're in a hallway, there you go. These are the price points of\nall the hotels we're visiting, and it gets really crazy\ntowards the end of the video. That was the $1 hotel. Now let's head over to\nthe $1,000 a night hotel. It comes with two beds, a living room, one bathroom. You could see me while I pee. And it's 200 feet below ground. We literally have this\nentire cave to ourselves.",

Where'd Chris go? - It's getting a little creaky. That actually kinda\nlooks like the entrance to a horror movie. Yeah, I think this is\nwhere we call it a day. - As the night went on, the boys discovered a\nkeyboard right beside my bed. Oh, no way.",

Boys, let me do the honors. - Allow him. - Oh!\n- Oh, my gosh. This place is nice. For $10,000 a night, you get three bedrooms. - Could've done without the\nentire forest on my bed. - What's wrong",

I laid claim to the fish room, and not gonna lie, it's kinda trippy just\nbeing surrounded by fish. - We still have so many hotels to go to. - Exactly why we need to get some sleep. - All right, good night. - And that was the $10,000",

There's 110 people that take care of the three of us? - Yup. - I feel so special. - Apparently up the side\nof this little mountain is our little casitas. - Here we are, welcome home. - Holy crap. This is crazy. - Is this Nolan's room?\n- Yeah. - Nolan! - I'm not next to this goofball am I? - Nolan! - And you indoor/outdoor shower. - Wait, so I can shower with\nthis door to outside open? - Yeah. - So what are we supposed to do? - I don't know. - Usually, we would do\nlike a tour",

Wow, that takes dessert to the next level. Relaxed on a private beach. I haven't felt this peaceful\nin a very long time. Took a ride on a private plane. And we ate even more food.
