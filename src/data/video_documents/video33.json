And to celebrate I bought\nthis ginormous private island, and I'm giving it to one\nof you in this video! So, I brought 100 of my\nsubscribers to compete in four extreme challenges. Last one standing wins this island. The first challenge is simple. First 50 people to start a fire and light their torch move on! Begin! - See the smoke on that? How is it not lighting? - This isn't easy, guys. He's not giving it away. - Do none of you",
        "1": "want an island? - I'm trying! - Then start a fire faster! - According to our estimate, it's gonna take them on average 20 minutes to start the fire. (contestant yells) Really? Oh wow! By 20 minutes I meant one minute. - Thank you, fire god! - [MrBeast] Continue to the raft! - Here we go, baby. I'm not going home today. - Yes! Yes! - The color green, that's\ngonna be the color of money. - Nothing's lighting up. Oh my God! - Did he get it? - God bless America! God bless America! - See that ship right there,",

See that pirate ship over there? - [Tariq] Yes. - [MrBeast] That's challenge number three, and we're literally throwing\npeople off the ship. Trust me, you wanna watch this video. This is the easiest of all the challenges. - Yeah! - Only 10 spots remain! - Come on, come on! (contestant yells) - I freakin' did it! - Three spots left! - My flint is worn down. I'm not giving up.

We have our 50 contestants! (contestants cheer) In just one challenge, 50\npeople lost their chance to win this beautiful private island. And now it's time for\nchallenge number two, red light, green light because Squid Game's\nour most viewed video, so why not bring it back? And unlike last time, we're\nin the middle of the ocean. Seriously, the middle of the ocean. Bring in the 50 remaining",
        "4": "contestants. Come on in, come on in. - I'm so freakin' nervous right now. - Since you all are subscribers, I assume you saw the\nfirst Squid Game video. - Yeah! - [MrBeast] Okay, well, this\none's a little different. Only the first 20 to step on the red line or cross it move on, okay? - Okay! - The red line, that's\nall we're thinking about. 20 people. - There is no time limit. Green light. Red light. - [Nolan] He just completely moved. - We have our first official elimination. Green light. Red light. Chris, I'll give you the chance to",
        "5": "do one. - Green eggs and ham. I'm sorry, guys. I had to be a little ruthless. - The beauty of this red\nlight, green light is there's no time limit. I can just put the mic\ndown and wait 10 minutes. - [Nolan] You're looking a little shaky. Are you scared? - I gotta win an island. - I can't feel my feet at all, but I'm just just imagining\nmyself on an island. (harp music) - We're gonna be here a while. Does anybody need a snack? - Wait, wait. You're definitely eliminated. - [Tariq] You did say \"red\nlight, green light\"",
        "6": "at the end. - Red light. Red light. Let me review the footage\nand see if he's correct. - When you were explaining\nthe rules you said- - Red light, green light\nis there's no time limit. Yeah, we have our first\nfinisher by technicality. - I was worried I threw it all away, but I thought I heard it. - It was green light. I'm surprised more of you didn't catch on. Red light. Every word that leaves this\nmouth I gotta think it through. Green light. Red light. Ooh! - That was the most\nnervewracking thing of my life. - [MrBeast] Green light. Red",

Good effort. 15 spots remain for a chance to compete for a private island. Green light. Red light. Well, you're good, you're good. There are two slots remaining. She's obviously gonna cross\nlook how close she is. Please, no one hurt yourself. Green light. Oh, he got it first. He got it first.\n- Yeah, baby! - Oh my God. - Yes! - I was this close. - As a thank you for coming out, we're",

I need to know who the\nearliest subscriber here is. Since this is our 100\nmillion subscriber special, we wanted to give our earliest subscriber a competitive edge, so we told her this. I need you to eliminate half the people, whoever you want to go. Just pick half of them. - No, you're joking. - [MrBeast] But it\ndidn't take long for her to just start picking people. All right, one",

Do you wanna just have someone else pick? - No, I don't wanna go. Okay. - Oh my God, dude. - Wow. - I love you all! It's been a great ride! - Oh! - [Gabbie] I'm so sorry. - Ah, this is brutal. - [Gabbie] I'm so sorry. - I'll take it. - No way. - This is terrible. - Oh my God.",

(contestants cheer) - That was like a bullet\nevery time she said someone. - My heart. - And now that we have 10 people, that's the exact amount\nthat could fit in our raft. Follow me. We're gonna tug 'em over to\nthat pirate ship right there and eliminate some more. Welcome. Have you ever",
        "11": "been on\na pirate ship before? - Not once in my life. (dramatic music) - It's been a long journey to get here. You had to fight from 100 down to 10. I don't even know if you\nguys notice, but back there, that's the island you\nguys are competing for. (contestants cheer) - And half of you aren't\neven gonna step foot on it. - [Contestant] Yeah, we hate you, Nolan. - I am so excited to be out here competing for a private island. - I'm already planning out the structure. Mansion's gonna go there. - As soon as I win the",

And attached to each plank is a rope. When we cut the rope, five of them will drop you\nand five of them won't. (contestants groan) - That's gonna be wild. - Who wants to go first? - I'll do it! - Come on up, sir. You can pick any of these 10 planks.

Don't fall off the boat! Now all your odds are actually worse. And while she's deciding her plank, I wanna tell you guys about Shopify. Shopify is an easy to use platform that makes starting a business\nas easy as using your phone. Can you say, \"I love Shopify?\" - I love Shopify. I love Shopify, I love Shopify. - Oh my gosh, it worked! We have two of the",
        "14": "five finishers. Oh, now your odds are even worse! - No. - Pick any of the eight remaining planks. - I'm so nervous for you, bro. - Oh, Lordy. - I've personally been\nusing Shopify to sell merch since we had three million subscribers, which is crazy 'cause\nwe're on 100 million now. We also use it to sell our\nchocolate bars and so much more. I don't know why, but I have a feeling\nthis is gonna drop him. - Three, two, one. - Let's go! - He's safe? Three people have already made it. This is extreme luck. - Only two spots",

Before we cut the rope, I just wanna let you know\nthat Shopify believes in creators like us and wants\nto help us turn our ideas into businesses. Isn't that great? - Yeah. - Chandler, cut the rope. (dramatic music) No way. (contestants yell) There's only five working planks and somehow they picked four of them. - There's only one safe plank left. - Oh my God. I was so ready to go swimming. - Since these four people\nsomehow",

Cut it. - Oh geez. - Go quicker! - Oh! Oh my God. - Oh! - One down! - He fell! - At least now I know the\nplanks really do work, and they're just lucky. - Remember me. - Okay, so do you use\nShopify to sell anything? - No. - Then the gods probably won't bless you. Let's see it. (contestant yells)",
        "17": "That's what happens when\nyou don't use Shopify. - I'll miss him. - Bye. I didn't mean to clap. That was rude. - Do any of you winners\nwanna cut this next rope? Do you wanna cut it? Come over here. Yeah, don't fall. Cut the rope when you want. - I'm praying for you, my boy. - Oh snap! Wow. - I feel crazy right now.

One is moving on. There's never been a better\ntime to make a Shopify store. Just go to shopify.com/mrbeast.

Let's go! (everyone yells) - [MrBeast] And that is our final victor! - 100 people. We're the five left. - Hey, sorry you didn't win an island! Thanks for coming out! - Love you, Gabbie! - Captain, set sail for the island. Welcome to the island. Look how beautiful this beach is.",

This island has a cabana, a helicopter pad, a beautiful pool. It is nice. - Maybe I won't sell the island anymore. - I mean, yeah, it's pretty beautiful. - This island is amazing.\n- This is absolutely unreal Life changing. - And now we have one final challenge to decide which one of\nyou wins the island. - Let's go! - But before we do that\nchallenge, I have a proposition.

This man's- - Going for the island, baby! - [MrBeast] He just lit 50 grand on fire. - That could be the biggest\nmistake of his life. - You want 50 grand in cash\nor to compete for an",

How about you? 50 grand's a lot. - $50,000 couldn't even pay\nfor a year's worth of tuition. - Oh my gosh. That's sad. - I'll take my chances. - She wants an island! - Oh my gosh. Wow! If you stay in, you only\nhave a 25% chance of winning. - This is the hardest decision\nI've ever had to make, but- - Are you gonna say no to $50,000? - We're going for the island, baby. - [Chris] Oh my goodness.",

I stayed in and everything\nelse has been luck so far and I've had great luck. I wanna keep trying. - No way, no way. Oh my God. Only one of you is winning this island. Oh my God. And for the final challenge, we have our 100 million\nsubscriber play button. Taped to the back of it\nis the deed to the island. I'm gonna go hide this, and whoever finds it\nfirst wins the island.

I'm gonna drive really far away, so they think we hid it far away, but then I'm gonna come back\nand hide it in front of them. - That's exactly what I was thinking. - I have to get into the\nmind of Jimmy right now. - I know exactly where\nJimmy's gonna hide it. He's gonna hide it in\nthe spot that I find it. - What? - That's exactly where it's gonna be. (Nolan laughs) - [Chandler] We should\njust throw",

If you look over there,\nyou'll see the contestants. They won't expect us\nto hide it this close. I say we",

Good luck. - [Chris] Go! - [Contestant] I have a\nfeeling it might be over here. - Get outta here, go your own way! - An island's on the line! - I don't regret throwing\n50 grand in a fire 'cause I'm gonna find this case. - Think in the mind",

I gotta give it to you. - Do you believe me now when\nI say this island's massive? - Yes, there can be so many possibilities. - It's literally four times bigger than the private island Chandler won. - You're right. - [MrBeast] The sun is setting, and I have no",

Congratulations. - I'm so happy, thank you. - No problem. - We all burned 50K in\nfront of each other. - Like idiots. - Boys! It's now time we open our 100 million subscriber play button.
