In the bottle. - No, no, no, no, in! - Let's see how many times we\ncan get Chandler to say that. Don't forget if you make\nthis that could determine whether or not you want\na chocolate factory. - First try. - I think that was the worst one yet. [Dramatic Music]",
        "14": "- [Everyone] Oh! - In and out! - [Chandler] This is it, this is the one. - [Everyone] Yeah! - Let's go! (all cheering) - It flew so high. - Whoever wins the Chocolate Factory, you might have a, a\nlittle stain on the side.

Here you go, you can sell it\nwhen you leave the factory. - You better win this now. - I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. - If you're wondering where that goes. I don't even know, next challenge. Now we're in a room\ncovered with marshmallows. Dive on the floor. (Logan grunts) Did that hurt? - No, not at all. - And in front of each of the contest,",

Whoever falls off first loses. - Do you feel bad about what you did? - I feel awful. - All right, just step off it. - No, I won't do it. - You can do it - No. - Don't push. - Currently they're not spinning. So let's move this here. Now they're spinning just a\nlittle bit, how is it everybody? - Pretty",

Now they're spinning faster. They all kinda look like MPCs, you know, in the character\nselection where they spin. You know what I mean? If you step here, step\nright while you're doing it, it'll help you with the sickness. Like 'cause you don't have to spin, you can just step in place. - Don't trust Jimmy. I don't trust that.",

(everyone yelling) - Why did that hit me in the head? - Even though he got out, I wanna show you guys\nthe faster speeds 'cause I spent a lot of money on this. - [Jimmy] Look at him over there. - Ah! - I can't feel my toes. - To the river. Before you step in the boat, I need you to assign them a number. One through four to each\nof them, who is number one? - Dallin. -\n- One? - Okay, so who's number two?",

All right, fine, get in the boat. - One last sweet treat\nfor the road, my guy. - Ah, thank you. Watch you fall in. - That could determine who\nloses a chocolate factory. Let's show you why that's relevant. There's four toilets behind me. Three are real, ones made of a cake. Whichever person picks the\ncake one is eliminated. - So if they're right they're wrong? - No, they have to be\nright about the wrong one. -",

Stand in front of it and face this way. Now we have number two, are you ready? - Yep. - Take the blindfold off. Five, four, three, - [Contestant] One. - Okay, go for it.

Being a boat captain's a piece of cake. (strong base) - And we have one final challenge left that will decide which\none of you walks away with this chocolate factory.",

And what better person to\ndecide which one of you wins a chocolate factory than, come on in, Gordon Ramsey, turn around. - Oh my gosh. -\n- No way. - How's it going man? And as you're probably guessing, the final challenge is a cooking challenge and they have 45 minutes to make a dessert for Gordon Ramsey to judge. He'll be judging on looks and taste, Begin!

It's gonna come in at a later moment. - A later moment? We haven't got much time.\nWe've only got 45 minutes. - A little stressed out right now. - Are you okay? - I'm good. I'm good. - He makes everything so\nmuch more intense, I love it. - What's the dessert? Look at me, you've done",

Can you work and talk at the same time? - I was about to say the same thing. - I probably should. (all chattering) - Honestly, I don't even know what to do. Gordon just kind of took over\nand it's really entertaining. - Just over 20 minutes, halfway guys, halfway to a amazing chocolate factory. - When I win this chocolate factory, do you wanna buy it off of me?
