Step inside the circle, and\nthe 100 day counter will start. The timer is ticking. He has to survive in\nthis circle for 100 days. - There's nothing here. - There's nothing yet. Chris! - I'm about to drop off a house. - This definitely gives\nme more confidence. - I bet you didn't know\nyou could lift a house with a crane. - I've had zero training. Wait, which one's the gas again? -",
        "1": "Whoops. Look out for the stairs. - You know what? Actually. - And inside this house\nis all the food, clothes, and supplies he needs to survive 100 days. - Oh, no. - This could have been a lot worse. - Oh, my God. - So, this is Shawn's family. I wanted to let you guys\nget one final goodbye in before he started the challenge. Aw. - No pain, no gain, Dad. - You guys will be here when\nI walk out of that circle with a half a million dollars. - I believe it. - But I'm gonna miss you guys.",
        "2": "- Aw. - I'm gonna cry a little bit. - The video just started,\nand it's already emotional. Good luck. $500,000 is on the line. - To be honest, it's a little emotional, but 300,000 calories, 100\ndays, I've got a plan. Get the food organized, clothing figured out, figure out a way to keep\nmy mind entertained, and I know if I walk out of that circle, I will regret it forever. One night down, 99 to go, let's go get organized. All right. Strategy session number one, I got to figure out what\nI got, how much I got, and what I'm",
        "3": "gonna do to organize it. - This is all the food you're getting for the next 100 days. So, if you eat all this in the first, let's say,\n50 days, you're done. - It looked like a lot more food until I started condensing it down. Shawn. - Hello. - We have over a dozen\ncameras monitoring his every move 24/7. If he steps on that red line, we will see it. What do you think the hardest part of this challenge will be? Solo failure. No one beats me. I didn't get outplayed. - He's still talking to us,\nand we're",
        "4": "outside the trailer. - Being in my own head. - Hey, Shawn, I think they walked away. - God, I hate them. Because Chris dropped\nmy house so perfectly, my shower doesn't drain. Huge shout out, Chris,\nreally appreciate 100 days of dealing with this. It is cloudy. So, it's a perfect day\nto get outside and try to plant some vegetables. Oh. I got to pay attention where I'm walking. 'Cause if I walk across that, game over. That red line is death. If I touch it, it's over. So, I'm gonna take the wood out back and create kind of like",
        "5": "a secondary line. All right, now I got my beautiful circle. - Shawn. - Come in. - How's it going, man? - Doing good. - Wait a minute. Is this a Cheerio? This is all you get for 100 days. You're wasting a Cheerio. - All right, yay.\n- Wow, it is really stale. - I'm shocked at how fast\nShawn is developing a routine. It is officially day 10. Sorry I'm dressed like this. I just gave away a chocolate factory. Shawn is nowhere to be seen on these cameras. Shawn, are you pooping? - What? - Oh. Okay, he didn't",
        "6": "run away. - Yeah. Bro, how you doing? - Good, good.\n- Give me a hug. - All right. - Wait, so you're tracking your weight. - I'm weighing in every seven days. - So, you're trying to\njust be jacked by the end. - Yeah, so I mean, at the end of it, I'll be ripped and $500,000 richer. - Your wife's gonna love me. You seem to be doing really well. I'll see you in a month. - A month? I think he's kidding,\nbut he's probably not. I'm gonna try to build a garden today. I'm gonna try to replant",
        "7": "it away from that crazy red line. One of the things I plan\non doing with the money is to put my farm 100% on solar power. My farm will be like a giant Tesla. That's the dream. That's what we're trying\nto do at the homestead. Can't wait to get out and get my money, and I'm gonna go on a nice\nvacation for a while I think. Whoa, Jimmy just told me\nthere's a tornado watch. Are you gonna leave the\ncircle for the severe weather? I'm like, I'm from Oklahoma. Whoa. There's no way that tarp is\nworth a half million dollars. Oh",
        "8": "yeah, here it comes. My poor money's blowing away. Okay, I'm going inside. I have water peeing from the ceiling, but my toilet won't flush\nbecause I'm guessing the tank out there is full of water\nfrom the rain leaking into it. Can you guys see that gentleman behind us? He's been in that circle for 16 days. - That's longer than you went\nwithout eating, bald guy. You didn't have to bring up that video. - Have you seen your second floor yet? - No. I've been trying to get up there. - It's a bit steep. - Hey, Jimmy, you're bald.",
        "9": "- Yeah, I'm just gonna stay out of it. I feel like if I stay in here,\nthey will bother each other and not me. - Since the boys were being rude, I'm gonna leave them trapped. - We want out. - I will bring the ladder\nback if you just apologize. - Let us out. - We want out. I think we're ready to get out. - I want an apology. - I'm sorry you're bald. I'm sorry I called you bald. - Was it that hard? - Yeah, it hurt. So, the boys made quite the mess of my house",
        "10": "yesterday. My yard is now covered in glass. Very frustrating. - I'm worried this\nchallenge might be getting to Shawn. - Would you come into my\nhouse and screw with stuff? I don't think so. \u266a Someday I'm gonna be \u266a Oh. Thing just smacked me in the nuts. \u266a So, more, more money, more me \u266a How you doing, Chandler? - I'm scared. - I would be too. We installed that Ferris\nwheel in two hours. - Get me down. - Shawny. So, for you being 25% done, we brought you a carnival\nso you can enjoy the day. - This is awesome.",
        "11": "Nothing but net. Aw. Bruh. - Oh. First throw. There we go. Oh. - This mini game isn't very fun. - Oh, my gosh. I'm so terrified of heights. You're 25 days in. Do you still think you're\ngonna make it the full 100? - I can't see why not. This competition's a huge sacrifice. I only get so many summers\nwith my kids, right? Before they're gone and out of the house. So, that's tough. So, I was organizing all my\nclothes and as I was going through it, I started\nfinding little notes. They're from my daughter, my youngest. I have four",
        "12": "kids and a wife, and this will be the most\nalone I've been in 18 years. Rationing food, survival\nis gonna be rough, but if anything makes me walk out of here, it's gonna be the loneliness. I just don't want to think about it. All I know is Gordon Ramsey, he ain't got nothing on me. - Because I only gave him\n300,000 calories of food, Shawn really had to think\nabout how he rationed it, which led us some pretty\ninteresting choices. - So, this may be my first bad one. It's just a bunch of\nleftovers boiled for safety. - It's disgusting. -",
        "13": "Very cabbagey. There's a camera above me. I'm not sleeping naked during\nthis 100-day challenge. Jimmy, just know I did that for you. Just to spare you from my nakedness. This morning I heard, hey, Shawn, there's a spider in your bed. My bed is now flipped over. I'm leaving the circle. This is my last day. You know you've been here a\nlong time when living inside of a circle in a Mr.\nBeast video seems normal. Day 39, it's Father's Day. I kept waking up thinking I was home. Really missing my family. This is gonna be a tough day. -",
        "14": "And what Shawn didn't know\nis that I brought his family to the circle to surprise\nhim for Father's Day. Shawn, I have a present for you. - Oh, yeah? - Happy Father's Day.\n- Daddy. Daddy. - Almost makes me feel bad\nfor trapping him in here. They didn't really consult with me. They just brought a present, and I'm not about to tell this little girl she\ncan't give her a dad a present. So, I caved, and here you go. Oh, okay, I approve of this here. - Oh, my gosh. - Not only did they give you\na gift, but they also",
        "15": "get to spend the next 24 hours with you. No way. You guys are gonna be so bored. - Are those my drawings on the fridge? - Yeah, those are your\ndrawings on the fridge. - What is this? - Nice. I didn't think you would keep these. - Oh, it's the wife. Ah. - It had nearly been a month\nsince Shawn saw his family. So, I decided to give them some privacy\nuntil the next day. - Well, it must be nice\nto be able to walk out of the red circle. Yep. - Really appreciate it, Jimmy. That was the best.",
        "16": "- It's a new day, and Ryan is here, who traveled across America to give me this penny. - Hey, guys. - Shawn, I'm coming in. - Come on in. - Do you know what he's carrying? - A penny. - Do you know why he's\ncarrying this penny? - My kids told me all about this. You're bringing it-\n- Oh, wait, really? - Yeah.\n- Oh, no. I'm gonna give it to\nyou for entertainment. - Really? - Here you go. Tomorrow is day number 50,\nand we have a big surprise for him, but don't tell him, okay? - Okay. - Okay.",
        "17": "- Okay.\n- All right, later, Shawn. - Yay! - It is officially day 50 of\nShawn surviving in the circle, and I invited some of my YouTube friends to celebrate this special moment. - It's us, his YouTube friends. - I need a break. Shawn. Shawn, what day is it? - 50. - Exactly. In front of you is $100,000 in cash, and if you get out\nright now, I'll let you keep it. - No. - What, why? - 100 grand? I can just chill here and get another 400. - It's like you're enjoying this. - All right, what if\nit",
        "18": "was like 150 grand? Would it still be enough? - I think like above\n400, I would think about- You're crazy. 400 grand? Okay, well, in case you did say yes, I invited a marching band. Bring in the marching band. - 50 days. - Do you want to know what\nthe best part about this is? I paid them to be here all night. Good luck. For the first 50 days, I wanted to see if Shawn could make it. - I've done this, right? I've done 50 days. For the last 1/2 of this challenge we have some\npretty crazy stuff",
        "19": "planned. - This is probably\nsomething you'll never see. - Oh, my God. - Oh, crap. - Honestly, I didn't think\nit was gonna end like this. July Fourth, day 54. Happy birthday, America. - You guys ready? They're lighting 'em. They're lighting 'em. Go, go. Happy Fourth of July, Shawn. What if he got out right now? - Got to watch out for the circle. - Go inside. - Please- - Bro, I just bought random fireworks. I didn't know they were that crazy. - Oh. - Cease fire. Cease fire. I can't even see- Oh, fuck.\n- Oh, fuck. - Was",
        "20": "that a good show or what? - Yeah, it was incredible. - Honestly, we should\nbecome firework experts. - Yeah, dude, I basically am. - All right, Shawn. More importantly, it is now July 5th, which means we need to leave. - Yeah. - No more fireworks. - We're not gonna celebrate\nanything on July 5th. - Okay, thank you. I'm a little terrified of\nwhat Jimmy comes up with next. - Did you say you're terrified\nof what I'm gonna come up with next? - Yes. - Do you want me to just\nleave you alone for a month? - No, that'd be even",
        "21": "worse. - Okay, see you in a month. - Oh, no. - No, you did this, Shawn. - Another month? That's like almost all\nthe days that are left. Here's the aftermath. There's multiple times\nwhere I was way too close to the edge. You got to watch out for the circle. So, I'm thinking about digging a moat. And if Jimmy's really not\ncoming back for 30 days, I should have an entire moat built by time he gets back. Today, I ate a can of mixed\nvegetables and a can of turkey. I didn't even heat it up. Food is going to",
        "22": "be an issue. This is meat, and it smells. and I've kind of tapped out the things to do\ninside the 60-foot circle. I dug a moat, made a\ngarden, made a fire pit, which is too hot to use, made\nlike a fence around the back, and made a hammock. So, I'm just here existing. I don't feel like doing really anything. So, I'm just going to sleep. That is Shawn's house, and I haven't been there in 30 days. Let's see if he's still alive. Just kidding I check in on\nthe cameras every single day. I know he's alive. Looks like",
        "23": "he dug a\nmoat around the circle. Let's see how he's doing. - Hey, man.\n- Hey. - Did you miss me? - Yes. - Well, does it feel refreshing? - Like I'm seriously shaking. - You're that excited to see us? - Yeah, no, definitely. - Wow. - I didn't- - I had no idea that not visiting Shawn for 30 days would affect him this much. - No. - You do look much thinner. Did you lose weight? - I'm 22 pounds down. - Wow. We've done a lot since you last saw me. What did you do? And this",
        "24": "is my storm window, and I sit here, and\nwatch the storm come in, and listen to the lightning. - Proud of you. - Thank you. - Things are about to start ramping up. The last 10 days are gonna be crazy. - What'd you say? - Don't worry about it. - Honestly, I thought that\n30-day challenge was kind of like my hard challenge, but it sounds like he's not done with me, which is a little concerning. - Shawn, what's the best\nway to cut a cake in 1/2? - With a knife. - Okay. What's the best way to cut",
        "25": "a house in 1/2? - Oh, shoot. - Look, he keeps checking all the windows to see if we're gonna\ncut the house in 1/2. Look at that. He's gonna be so confused\nuntil I return tomorrow. - So, I was calling Jimmy's bluff on this, but then I just look outside. - I need you to cut it in 1/2 and get rid of that 1/2. - They're legit gonna cut my house in 1/2. - I just learned how to\ndrive this five minutes ago. Shawn, I just want to tell you that it's only gonna get harder. - That's what",
        "26": "I'm worried about. - No. - Wow. Wow. - Yo, watch out. - Oh, my God. - I didn't think this would actually work. - Am I good? - You're good. - Oh, my God. In a couple days we may or may\nnot just burn the house down. If I do anything, I'll\nlet you know beforehand. - Okay, yeah, thank you. That was a rough day. It's nine days to go at this point. I don't even care. Don't even talk about\nhow long I've been here. Well played, Jimmy. Well played. I'm staying. So, it's officially hotter\nin my room than",
        "27": "it is outside at this point. - Shawn, I will give you a quarter of a million dollars if\nyou get out right now. You know, it's hot. I want to give you a way out. - It is so hot. It's like 100 degrees today, but I think I'd rather die\nthan give up on this challenge at this point. - Really?\n- Yeah. - Well that was all. I'll see you tomorrow. - Oh. - I give you guys full\npermission to go full idiot mode. - Charge. - Oh, there's nothing going on up there. Don't worry about it. - Chandler",
        "28": "must be here. - Oh no, no, no. - I think I should go check\non what they're doing. - What? Over there? - Yeah. These windows are kind of- useless. - Yeah, but nothing hurts you\nmore than emotional damage. - Wow. - Oh. - Thanks for the entertainment, boys. See you tomorrow. I guess they're giving up. Here they come to get their fancy cameras. This is probably\nsomething you'll never see on the YouTube side. - And now the circle is\nsurrounded by speakers. - The worst part is it stops every once in a while and goes, it goes, oh,",
        "29": "and then it kicks right back on. Maybe if I knock them all over flat, I can fill the speaker with water. If I never eat processed food again, I think I might be okay. Hot. Oh, my God, hot. - All right, do you all\nsee that house over there? I want you to surround it\nin a circle and say nothing. Break. Should I be scared? - What the hell? - All right, attention, clowns. Nod your head if you can hear me. Okay, I'll give you all $1,000\neach if you stay all night. - Wait, I'll give you 2,000",
        "30": "if you don't. - There's like 11 of them. - Oh, there's 11 of them? Oh, my goodness. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Well, guess what? There's still clowns out there. Little extra security there. - You have less than 24\nhours left in this circle. So, we're gonna destroy your\nhouse with a wrecking ball to make it harder. - What? - Chris. - What? - Tear down the house. - All right. - Oh, God. And while Chris is destroying the house, I want to tell you guys about the sponsor of the video, Venmo. - Yeah. - Venmo",
