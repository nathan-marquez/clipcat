Which means you're now in the hotel which I didn't know you were in. - That's my bad.\n- Oh. - [Jimmy] I'm hiding in one of\nover 200 rooms in this hotel.

I'm on the 20th floor. - Go.\n- Do it for your daughter. - And now that he knows where I'm at I'm gonna try to do an ad\nread without getting stabbed. TurboTax is the number one way to get the biggest tax refund possible. On average last year, people get over $3,000\non their tax refunds. That's a lot of money.

Let's see if he can stab me while I'm hiding in this double\nreinforced steel bank vault. (walkie-talkie thuds) - Tracker stopped, luckily\nhe didn't get too far. Now I have an opportunity\nto stab him before midnight and get my money.\n- How's it going? -",

Mr. Assassin, there's two bank vaults and you picked the wrong one.",
        "17": "- Yeah, I saw one vault. Figured that'd be the one. - [Jimmy] Above the bank vault you're in is another bank vault. But you didn't pick that one. You picked the easy one and\nnow you're trapped with Nolan. Is that a sledgehammer? (sledgehammer thudding)\n(audio whistling) This thing's double steel reinforced, it doesn't matter. (sledgehammer thudding) - I really did fall for it, pretty bad at this one, didn't I? - [Nolan] Yeah. - Chris, see that hook right there? I need to attach it there. I'm gonna attach this one here.

(wall cracking)\n(Chris grunts) - There's some activity going on right outside of the door here. - Well, one, I might\nactually win the challenge. The only thing standing between that safe and the road is this brick wall. - Are you telling me to rob a bank? - Yeah, actually I am. - [Chris] And (indistinct). - Why is this thing moving. - [Jimmy] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\n- Oh, my God. (upbeat rock music) (Nolan grunting) - What is happening?",
        "19": "- You didn't tell me about this part. - I can't believe that worked. If you're gonna rob a bank, why don't you just do it like this? Nolan, has the assassin\nattacked at you yet? - Well, I'm talking to you, Jimmy, so no. - Darn. Now we're gonna drive you\n10 miles down the road. - I can't take this. - Yeah, we're not going on the highway, are we? - You have one hour left to win this hundred thousand dollars. I'll make your transportation quick. All right, get 'em outta here. (vault crashing) - Did we get lifted",
        "20": "up\ninto the air at some point? (triumphant music) - [Jimmy] Oh, and as promised. (bank explodes) (upbeat music) Literally, everything has\ngone according to my plan. I crushed his car,\nbamboozled him at the hotel, escaped in a Lamborghini and a helicopter, and now he's trapped in a safe with Nolan. There is less than 40 minutes\nleft in the challenge. So we're heading to one last location, because keeping him in a bank vault kind of feels like we're cheating. For our last location, we built a carnival, but all\nof this is a very expensive and elaborate distraction while I'm gonna try",

I'm gonna go over there\nand break my ankle. All right. (ladder thuds)\n(siren blaring) I've never broken a film before. We ended the production and\nhad the camera crew leave. The only cameras that kept rolling were hidden spy cameras from far away. There's 20 minutes left in the challenge. Let's see if he still stabs\nme even though I'm hurt. I think you should let him out, Tareq. Guy, get ready.",

(suspenseful music)\n(knife clinks) - Yeah, I don't know about that. (suspenseful music)\n(heart beating) - So, was it that obvious? - Whoo! Let's go!\n(triumphant music) You don't splint a broken ankle. - That is true. I should have broke my leg.",

Thank you.\n- Well, now I'm glad you stabbed me. That was a weird sentence. Thank you guys for watching. - Subscribe or I'm gonna hunt you down. \u266a Mr. Beast goes \u266a (bank explodes) - Jimmy is it over? - Jimmy\n(hotel explodes)"

        "8": "In the image, there is a person in the foreground wearing a dark-colored hoodie, looking directly at the camera with a playful or cheeky expression. Behind them is a brightly lit Ferris wheel at night, suggesting that the photo is taken at an amusement park or fair. The person appears to be posing or acting, and the lighting highlights their face while the background is more dimly lit, drawing focus to them.",
        "4": "The image shows a night-time indoor scene with a focus on a window of a building. There are large red arrows with text labels pointing to two different figures. The figure on the left of the window is labeled with \"ASSASSIN\" while the figure on the right, who appears to be inside the building, is labeled with \"JIMMY.\" The one labeled \"ASSASSIN\" seems to be in a climbing or crouching pose on the exterior side of the building, while \"JIMMY\" looks to be standing and possibly unaware of the other person's presence. The scene can be associated with a playful or fictional scenario, such as a game or a skit, especially given the context provided by the labels, but without more information, it's not possible to provide specifics about the actual context or what is transpiring in the image.",
        "5": "This is a blurry image taken in a commercial kitchen. There is a person in a dark suit, seemingly a man, appearing to be in motion, maybe walking or turning around. The person's face is not clear. In the background, there are stainless steel kitchen appliances, potentially a sink and some shelving or prep tables, and what looks like various kitchen utensils and supplies. The lighting is bright, probably from fluorescent lights, common in commercial kitchens for visibility while preparing food.",
        "7": "The image depicts two individuals standing near a brick building. The person on the left is wearing a dark green jacket, black pants, white sneakers, and a red backpack. The person on the right is wearing a long beige coat, denim jeans, and a pink beanie hat. They appear to be engaged in a conversation. There's a bush to the left and part of a chain barrier in front of the brick wall. It seems to be taken during evening or nighttime due to the artificial lighting and darker sky.",
        "6": "The image shows an interior space that appears to be a lobby or entrance area of a building. There is a person in the foreground, seen from behind, wearing a dark-colored suit. The person is walking towards the interior of the building. The room features modern decor, with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, columns, a tiled floor, and a reception or information desk in the back. There is a mounted screen or monitor on the back wall, and some framed items on the wall to the right. The lighting is bright, and the overall impression is of a professional or business environment.",
        "2": "The image is overexposed, making it difficult to discern all the details clearly. Nevertheless, it features a person in what appears to be a suit, standing amidst a number of blue objects that look like barrels or similar containers. The person seems to be in an outdoor setting given the hint of trees and sky in the background. Additionally, there is text overlaid on the image that says \"HE'S GONE!\" and a digital on-screen graphic in the top left corner that appears to indicate elapsed time, with sections labeled \"HOURS,\" \"MINUTES,\" and \"SECONDS,\" although their values are not visible.",
        "3": "The image shows two men inside a room or hallway. The man on the left is wearing a dark coat over a lighter shirt and is looking to his right at the other man. The man on the right has longish hair, is wearing a greyish long-sleeve shirt, and appears to be in mid-conversation or making a point. He is holding a green binder or folder. From the positioning, it seems the man with the binder may be stepping out of or standing by a door, possibly exiting or entering a room. The environment suggests an indoor setting with walls painted in neutral colors. The context of their interaction isn't clear, but they appear to be engaged in a discussion.",
        "1": "In this image, there is a person standing in what appears to be the hatch of a tank or a large military vehicle. They are holding a phone to their ear with their left hand and seem to be engaged in a conversation. The individual is wearing a beige coat over what seems like a formal outfit and has long hair pulled back. The background shows a set of train tracks with railroad cars parked on them, suggesting that this might be taking place in a train yard or near some sort of rail infrastructure. The setting indicates an outdoor environment given the sunlight and shadows visible.",
        "0": "The image appears to show a motion-blurred scene of people, likely taken on a high-speed amusement park ride, which creates the impression that they are moving very fast. The blur suggests speed and motion, and the people in the picture seem to be experiencing various levels of excitement or thrill associated with the ride. The background is indistinct due to the motion blur, making it difficult to discern specific details."
