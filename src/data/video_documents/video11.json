Speaking of which, we're\nat the million dollar house, which technically means you need to be\na millionaire to buy this house. Let's show you\nhow a millionaire lives. My first impression\nis it's way bigger than my house. When you pay $1,000,000,\nyou get a pretty good sized kitchen, along with four bedrooms\nthat look normal. But they keep going because",

Wait, what? These chairs each\nhave two remotes. Two remotes! On top of the movie theater,\nthere's also an arcade. I was not expecting\nall these features for $1 million. This house is awesome.

I don't belong here. This looks like the house\nthat you tried to get to in GTA. That view is crazy. The pool is much smaller\nthan the $1 million house, but you can literally oversee\nall of L.A. Help! Hey! Help!",

This guy was the top attorney in 2017\nand the number one lawyer in 2021. Apparently, that's all\nit takes to afford this house. It appears a note was left for us. Dear MrBeast, thank\nyou for visiting my home. You have given me the ultimate gift. I have a trump card with my kids\nforever. Also, please don't eat\nany of the sandwiches. They are very sacred to me and my family's been passing",

The lower floor of this mansion comes with its very own movie\ntheater and personal gym. This treadmill requires a passcode\nto use. Six, nine, six, nine. It's not six, nine, six, nine. A guest bedroom, an entertainment\narea and a bar where the owner left us a bunch of free food. - Guys, before you eat anything.\n- Yeah.

Nolan, stop this cushion also. Stop throwing cushions. If it goes over the edge he might sue me.

Well, Edison made the light bulb.\nNot Ben Franklin. What the hell did\nBen Franklin do? I'm going to read this book.

That's not even close to\nthe coolest thing about this place, because next door\nis a garage filled with exotic cars. This looks like a garage\nout of a video game.

How do you even buy these cars?\nHey, I want three of the same ones. It's like a full time job\nto buy this many cars. There's stairs in the corner.\nLet's see where they go. Bro, this is like a\ncloset with cars. Underneath the car garage\nis another army of cars. They should really invest in a light\nswitch down here. They have 20 cars down here,\nbut no lights. - Did I...?\n- No",

Now, don't get me wrong,\nall of the rooms in this house\nhave been awesome so far. But if I owned it, I don't think\nI'd ever leave this next building. This is awesome. That's right. For some just ungodly reason,\nwhoever built this place thought it would be a good idea to install an\nentire indoor tennis court.

Bro, this place literally has everything. All right, I'm never leaving. We're playing ping pong\nin a basketball court, in a house. First try, baby! Now, all of the features of the $30\nmillion house have been pretty cool. But this next room is\nwhat makes this place truly special. Head up these stairs\nfor the best part of the estate.

The good news is it's a $45\nmillion mega-mansion. - What!\n- Oh, my gosh. This is like the most open house\nI've ever been in. What? I don't know what majestic thing\nthis is, but it's beautiful.

Mark's also the proud owner of\nthe Dallas Mavericks basketball team.

In case you're wondering,\nwe didn't go swimming. It looks like I did go swimming. - How much do they want for this house?\n- 45. - Not worth it?\n- Because it's Brentwood.

Yeah. Okay. We need to get on Mark's level. The number one rule is, you have to\nhave a heated seat. That's it? - That feeling when you sit down...\n- And it is not cold? I agree.

Up next, we have a house\nwhose price point happens to be my favorite number. And now we are at the $69 million\nmansion. That looks like a villain owns it. It does look villainous. How's this compare to your house, Miranda? It's a lot bigger than mine. That can't be sure.\nWhat's your address?

Dude, this is literally an ice room. - This is where you lock me in?\n- No. Please don't. So, what do you do in here? They ran out of room ideas.
