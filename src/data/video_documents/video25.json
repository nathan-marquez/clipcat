Right, all right, see you later. And now that that plane has left, boys, there's no way out for the next 50 hours. - We're stuck. - [Jimmy] First, we need to\ntrek towards the mountains, to get some protection from the wind. - This is the most beautiful\nplace I've ever seen. - Shut up, Nolan.\n(laughter) - There's",

The hard part about Antarctica\nis the sun never goes down.

Welcome to Antarctica. - [Jimmy] And in case you're wondering how you eat in the most\nremote place on the planet. First, you boil water, then you pour the boiling hot water, you gotta be careful, in here. And then in 10 minutes, you have food. And that's how you eat in Antarctica. - Oh, you don't know how good that tastes. (wind howls) - [Dream] I am so ready to sleep. - In my tent is Nolan and Dream. And Karl, who's in yours?",
        "5": "- [Karl] It's me, Chandler,\nSapnap, and George. - You're going to bed, right? - [Karl] Yeah. - I am so tired, I'm sick. Antarctica, not a good\nplace to get sick in. - Jimmy has no idea\nWe're digging a tunnel. - Oh my God.\n- Let's go. - It's just so crazy how he's so far down. - [Dream] Jimmy, I don't think\nI'm gonna make it 50 hours. - The wind is picking up, so we're gonna have a hard time sleeping. All right, guys, well, bro fist out. - [Jimmy] The sun\nliterally never goes down in Antarctica, so night one was",

'Cause the sun's just always up. - Morning one, this is miserable. - Bro, Antarctica is not a funin' place. (George laughs)\nI'm sick, man. I woke up coughing up blood. - Before you can leave\nyour tent in Antarctica, you need long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, a second pair of pants (grunts), a third pair of pants, a jacket, a jacket for your jacket, a ski mask, whatever this is, gloves,\ngloves for your gloves, gloves and goggles so your\neyeballs don't freeze.

There's a drop to my right. If I fall backwards, I roll for 2000 feet. (Jimmy grunts)\n- Jimmy. - What? - We're 30 hours in! - Oh, yes! - This is a huge cliff. No joke, no joking. - [Jimmy] If we fall down there, we die. - [Nolan] Yeah, hundred percent. - Karl's still digging\nthough it's so deep. - Bro, how am I gonna get",

(Jimmy exhales)\n- Hey, just don't mix up the water bottles. - Oh yeah. See those tiny little specks over there? That's our base camp. I wonder what the boys are up to. - Here comes the airplane, mmm. - Ah-um. - Yummy.\n- Yum! - The hole provides, and now\nhe must provide for the hole. - While Jimmy's climbing the mountain, we could",

This is the best use of our time possible. - [Jimmy] Stop filming me and\nfilm that view over there. It feels like we're on a different planet. You can't convince me this is Earth. And while we climb this mountain, I wanna tell you guys about Shopify. A platform that makes starting\na business incredibly easy. Shopify helped me provide\nYouTube channel into a business. And they can do it for",

We've claimed the mountain. (music crescendos) We did it! And now that we climbed the\nmountain, we gidda name it. I think we should name it \"Shopify.\" Because, to be honest,",

You know the best part\nabout climbing a mountain? - What?\n- You have to climb down. - No, no. - Also, you can't leave things behind, so I gotta take this flag down. - I carried it up all the way for that? What do you think they're\ndoing at camp right now? - Not something intelligent. (George growls) - Best snow day ever! - These sleeping bags are complicated. What is this?

Ow, Jimmy. (buzzing sound)\nI'm not a bed. Where is everybody? - Nolan.\n- Dream. - Dream!\n- Oh, my god! How long were you gone for? - Something's not normal.

Whoa, wait, how deep is that hole? - It's like eight feet deep. - I'm confused. - What's so confusing? It's just a hole. - Yeah, but why? - We're just trying to, you\nknow, make use of our time. - I'm too tired to understand this. - Get in the hole! - [All] Yeah! Hole, hole, hole.\n- How?

Do you guys wanna watch \"Blind\nMan Sees for the First Time?\" Or \"I Ate the World's Largest Burger?\" - Blind Man Sees for the First Time. - I wanna see the blind man, actually. - Okay.\n- There you go.

It's so cold that the screen\non the camera just went black. - This is actually freezing outside. - I don't wanna be here anymore. I'm gonna head to bed. - This the camera tent. We're saying good night. Good night, everybody. - Climbing a mountain\nreally took it out of me. And we got back at four in the morning. It was nearly impossible to\nget out of bed on day three. - It's the last day. You guys ready? Jim?\n- What? - We have to pack up\nbefore",

We are going to miss the flight. Actually, let me rephrase that. They're gonna miss the flight.

They are standing close together in a snowy mountainous environment, which suggests they might be engaged in a winter sport or mountaineering activity. They are all wearing cold-weather clothing such as heavy jackets, beanies, and sunglasses or goggles, which is suitable for the snowy conditions. Most of them are focused on a red object that they are all touching with one hand, symbolizing unity or collaboration. In the background, there is a tent, which indicates they might be on a camping trip or part of an outdoor excursion.",
        "4": "The image shows a snowy, mountainous landscape with what appears to be a hiker standing in the snow. The hiker is wearing cold weather gear, including a blue jacket and pants, a hat, and is equipped with a pair of trekking poles. The person appears to be on a trek or an exploration in a wintry environment, with extensive snow coverage and a cloudy sky overhead. The mountains in the background have steep, rocky faces and are partially covered by snow, contributing to the image's dramatic and cold atmosphere.",

One person is holding a green flag with a pole, and they appear to be dressed for cold weather with jackets and hats. The one in the foreground is wearing a black jacket and is gesturing or speaking, with an expression that suggests they are mid-speech or exclamation. In the background, the mountain and snow-covered landscape suggest they might be on some kind of expedition or outdoor adventure. To the right, there is an overlay of a hoodie that is not related to the actual scene and seems to have been digitally inserted into the image.",

The tent walls are partially transparent, which allows for the red light to pass through. The point of view is from someone lying down and looking towards the tent entrance, where another person is sitting inside. This person is likely an occupant of the tent. There are also various items spread around, such as shoes or boots, which indicates that the tent is in use, possibly for camping or an outdoor adventure. The overall mood seems to be cozy and enclosed, typical of a tent atmosphere during a camping trip.",
        "6": "In this image, there is a person inside a tent. The person appears to be wearing cold-weather gear, including a beanie and gloves, which suggests that they are in a cold environment, possibly involved in some form of outdoor or winter activity. The individual is holding a radio or walkie-talkie and seems to be in the middle of a communication, as indicated by the position of the device near their face. The red hue suggests that the tent fabric is filtering the sunlight, bathing the scene in a reddish tone. Inside the tent, we can see some gear and clothing scattered around, which is typical in a camping or expedition setting. The person looks content and engaged in their activity.",

The individual is wearing a cap and a black jacket and appears to be looking directly at the camera with a slightly surprised or inquisitive expression. Behind the person, there's a glimpse of what seems to be a sleeping bag or camping gear. The curvature of the tent poles is visible, providing structural support to the tent.

The person is bending over and appears to be in motion. In the background, there is snow on the ground, reinforcing the idea that this activity is taking place in a cold, snowy environment.

On the upper left of the image, there's a panel displaying \"Time Survived 05:36:43,\" suggesting that the time elapsed on the expedition or a challenge is being tracked, perhaps as part of a survival exercise or timed event. There is also a flag visible, but the image does not show enough detail to discern its design or significance.",
