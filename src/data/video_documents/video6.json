And every day you live here, I will\ngive you $10,000 in a grocery cart. That's wild, dude. Let's go. - Well I'll give it to you in 24 hours.\n- Okay. This challenge could literally\nmake Alex a multimillionaire, which in theory means\nhe could be in here for years. And it starts right now. All right, Jimmy's gone. Why would I ever leave?\nI could be here for years. Time to go grocery\nshopping, baby. Now, if Alex crosses this",

It's worth noting here\nthat we have countless cameras covering every square\ninch of the grocery store. For my first meal on night one,\nI guess I'll cook this steak. I think this is\njust going to be home base. This little\ncorner of the grocery store. If I have meals like this every night,\nI'll easily be here for years. Day one, complete.

        "2": "the first 10 grand. - Alex.\n- Hey. Can you feel this and confirm it's $10,000? It is. I believe you. Now, we introduced the twist\nof the challenge. Basically,\nto receive the daily $10,000 you need to give me $10,000\nin product from the store. And so you have to strategize\n what order to get rid of these items to stay here as long as possible. Okay. Conveniently,\nthere's a lot of electronics over there that are pretty\nexpensive for day one. That's probably a good idea. I can't really eat a TV,\nso it's no use to me. You're $0.22 over. All right, let me",

I will see you tomorrow\nwith another $10,000 in cash. You should start strategizing\nwhat you're going to sell me. This changes everything. I got to start strategizing for the future. I have to figure out all of\nthe stuff that I need to get rid of. Pet food, pet items. Jimmy cannot pay me\nto eat this stuff, I swear. I got $10,000\nworth of dog food right here. I think",

Is that what you're selling to me\ntoday? Today it's dog food. Oh, my gosh.\nIt's going to take us forever to move. Wait, can we do like a... I let him clap.\nTransition, go for it. There we go. It's all over here at the register.\nIsn't that a cool effect? I love Beast magic. We're at $9,991.80, And for the final item,\nwe are now at $10,045. And something you should",

The next few days\nwere kind of a breeze for Alex. On day five,\nhe sold me $10,000 worth of produce. All this produce here,\nthey're going to go bad very fast. On day six, he sold me a bunch of diapers. And on days seven, eight and nine, he cleared out an additional\n$30,000 worth of products. He even discovered\nthe backroom of the store, and since he hasn't showered in 10 days, he built his very own makeshift",

Oh, I mean,\nI feel like 100 days for sure. Oh, boy. Depending on how long Alex lasts, this may just become\nmy most expensive video ever, but I'm prepared for that. Holy crap, dude. I don't care if you go a year,\nI got the money. Who put all this in here,\nis what I want to know? The bank. You will get this once\nI get my $10,000 in items. All right,\ntoday I have",

Dogs. All right. I trust him. Even though\nthat was not what I was asking. Approaching day 11, Alex began to get pretty efficient\nat picking which items to sell. $10,001.89. And since I had to leave to go film a video\nwhere I stranded myself on an island... This is not comfortable. But let's pray we get like\n30 minutes of sleep tonight. We had someone",

And what he did\nwith the rest of his time to keep himself\nentertained was interesting. I am building a cheeseball wall. It's done. The great wall of cheese balls. Oh, yeah baby.\nHere we go. Three, two, one... It was worth it. It was so worth it. On day 13, Alex decided to upgrade\nhis shower because... It's a piece of crap. What I'm going to do, is use four of these shelves\nto reinforce the shower. Okay,",
        "9": "here we go. I am going to use plastic liner,\ndrape it across here. The walls are waterproof now. All right,\nYou got to give it to him. This man is literally constructing\na functioning shower out of just raw store parts. And there it is.\nShower's done. Time to test it. Okay. It's been a few days in here. I'm going to build a wall. Now, I never thought I'd see this, but Alex literally used\nall the water bottles in the entire store to build walls for his makeshift shelter. He even created a bed\nusing all of the toilet paper and it looked",
        "10": "kind of comfortable. This is pretty cozy. I could fall asleep right here. I got to get to scan in, kind of had my eyes\non these bad boys for a while. Gift cards.\nThese things are freaking expensive. It is actually surprising\nhow expensive birthday cards are. Because Alex was able to hit his\n$10,000 mark only using the cards. And after I got back\nfrom filming at the island... - Hey, Jimmy.\n- Hey, it's been a while. Alex wanted to see if we could help him\nuse the forklift in the back of the store. You know, if you could get it in\nthe store,",
        "11": "that'd be super helpful. You're sure you're going\nto let Kris drive this? Yeah. Three, two... Alright. Not the bakery. I think maybe one more. Yeah. Hey, it's in. Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enjoy your forklift. We'll see you tomorrow. Even though it's only been a day\nsince he last saw me, it seemed like Alex\nreally started to miss me. At least that's the only explanation\nI have for what he's about to do. I saw this\ncut out of Jimmy over here. We're going to be hanging out a lot,\nyou and I. He's just going to watch,\nmake sure I don't lose count. Just",
        "12": "scanning away for another 10k. $10,000.33 Over the next few days, Alex's efficiency was through\nthe roof, thanks to his new forklift. So he even had enough time\nto upgrade his bed. and it was quite the improvement. It's is so much better. And even though Alex's original goal\nwas to get a million dollars... I think we're going\nfor a mil on this one. I hope not. He started documenting\nwhat he'd spend the money on and came to realize maybe he didn't\nneed to stay as long as he thought. A million dollars is nice in theory. I'm still missing out\ntime with my boys.",
        "13": "Both their birthdays are coming up\nin the next two months. I've never missed a birthday yet. So after thinking about\nwhat I want to put the money toward, I realized that I need to\nat least make $500,000. But right now, I only have $200,000. So in total, I got 50 days, I got to be in here\nalmost halfway there. On day 22,\nAlex decided to absolutely decimate all the goldfish in the grocery\nstore. Oh, my God. Okay, so this is $10,000\nworth of goldfish. I could feed an army of toddlers. All right. Thank you, sir. You're living a regular life\nnow. Almost. You're",

However long you want. As you can see, the days\nstarted blending together for Alex. But eventually, the day came\nwhere he decided to sell the water that he originally used for his shelter. But since he couldn't\nsell the empty shelves in the store, he realized\nthey make pretty good walls. I'm going to reinforce\nthe house with metal shelves. This is the way.

So at any point now,\nall the power's going to cut off and his freezers won't work,\nthe lights won't work, and so much more. The challenge is going to get way harder. But to give them some motivation\nbefore things get pretty crazy. We thought Alex deserved a reward. - Are you excited to see your dad?\n- Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Yeah. I think he might literally cry.\nThis is gonna be crazy. Alex, we have a surprise for you. Hello.",

Yes, so when I bought this grocery store,\nthey gave me a form to put, like, the utilities in my name,\nand I just never filled it out. The cameras and cash registers\nare hooked up to a generator because we need those.\nSo what am I looking at over here? Okay, so I had originally $60,000\nready to go. Oh, my gosh.

Hold up. You can have the Kanga Cooler. You can fit a\nhuman head in here. Anyways, click the link in the description,\ndownload the shop app right now. You can buy a Kanga Cooler.

Alex spend the rest of his day rushing to get all the frozen\nfood sold so it can be donated. Guess I'll just be scanning stuff\nin the dark from now on. I really hope Jimmy turns the power on.

What are you going to do for\nthe rest of the time you're in here? Something I definitely want to do\nis go ahead and just run through all these shells\nwith the forklift. You ask for this!

It's been over a week, and Chandler won't tell me what happened\nwhile I was gone. This place looks\ncompletely different. Oh God, open the doors.\nI got to see this. Where did everything go?

That is complete boredom.\nHe's just tapping the bat on the ground. I would feel bad for him,\nexcept he's won $450,000, and he can leave whenever he wants,\nso he'll be fine. - Alex.\n- Hey.

Honestly, it's not worth staying\nand I\u2019m leaving. Okay, well,\nthen let's push the money out. All right, Alex, the second\nyou step on the red, it's over. I can move all the money back.\nWe can keep going.",

Can't believe this happened.\nThis is freaking sick. Congratulations, Alex. Shout out to Albertsons for helping us\nfill the shelves. You guys are amazing.\n I'm going to go find him a shirt.
