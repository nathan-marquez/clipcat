And when I say no food, I really mean it. This was the hardest\nI've ever pushed my body in my entire life. Seriously, do not try this at home. I had a whole team of doctors\nwatching me every single day. They kept track of all\nmy vitals, like these, to ensure I didn't have\na heart attack, or worse. Thanks, doctors! And if I for any reason eat\nfood in the next 30",
        "1": "days, Chris, you get to shave my head. - No way! - Yes. - There's no way he is going to 30 days. We're shaving his head. - The challenge has officially begun. - Guess you won't need these. (ceramic plate shattering) - You're right. And\nsince I'm not eating for the next 30 days, I might as well get rid of\nall the food in my house. - Or are you eating? - I'm not. - Or are you? - I'm not eating. And can you guys help me\nget rid of all this food? - Or is he? - It's like",
        "2": "legit, take all my food. I don't want a single calorie\nof food in this house. - Jimmy, question. If a fly flies into your mouth,\ncause your mouth is open, and you accidentally swallow\nit does that count as eating? - Uh, probably. - Yeah, we're that serious. - Enjoy the food! I'll see you guys later. You forgot the Cheetos. - Ow! Tomorrow, we're bi... - [Jimmy] Say it to the door. All right, the challenge\nis now getting serious. The boys are gone, and my\nkitchen is completely empty. Also, Chris accidentally\nbroke my microwave. (ceramic plate shattering) - The microwave broke. -",
        "3": "Thanks a lot, Chris. I'm laying in bed about to go to sleep, and it feels weird not\nhaving a snack before bed. I'm staying strong. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Typically when I wake up\nthe first thing I do is I go eat breakfast, but\nobviously I can't do that now. So, I guess I just go film videos. The only thing going in\nmy mouth for the next twenty-eight days is water. Let's go see how much weight I've lost. To be honest, I probably\nweigh basically the same. Yeah, like I said. And I'm about to go start\nfilming a different video;",
        "4": "so today's gonna be a\npretty difficult day. And the video we're filming is, we're seeing if this man\ncan spend a hundred days in this circle. Comment which you think is harder, spending a hundred days in a circle, or not eating food for 30 days. Filming on a completely empty stomach is much harder than it sounds. By the end of it, I was drained. (Jimmy weary sighing) That's probably like four\nor five hours of filming, and honestly, man, I need to go to bed. I'm tired now. - Hey, Chan-Chan, what you got there? - [Chan] Oh, just some",
        "5": "McDonald's. - I'm blowing the smells your way. - You are. - Jimmy, you want to eat me. - It's the end of day number two. Not gonna lie, I'm actually really hungry, and yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow. A lot of people say that\ndays three through six are the hardest, but for\nthe most part I feel fine. I'm just a little sluggish. And I just feel tired. Taking my first poop\nsince I started fasting. (background bell chiming) How much do I weigh? So, I'm down two and a half\npounds in the last day. That's actually pretty crazy. But",
        "6": "it does make sense, because I took a giant poop this morning. We're about to do a photo\nshoot for my snack brand, Feastables. And it sucks, because I can't eat 'em, and this is making me hungry. That's me smiling through the pain. You need me to take a bite of this? - Yes. - They want a photo of me\ntaking a bite of the bar. Can I have permission? I'll spit it out, I promise. - [Chris] Yeah, you can\ndo that, if in the picture you can have a shaved head. - [Jimmy] I hate you. All right, I'm",
        "7": "hanging up. Fake biting chocolate! This morning I was like,\n\"Yeah, I'm not that hungry. This isn't too hard.\" Now I'm like, \"Bro, I need to eat food.\" The boys told me they\nhave a surprise for me. Which is basically a\nnice way of them saying, they're about to torture me. - We just rented an ice cream truck. - Cause we wanna shave Jimmy's head. (frozen confection thudding) Oh, I'm sorry, Tareq! - All right, let's go! (truck speaker trilling\nTurkey in the Straw melody) Yeah! Oh, Jimmy! - I hear music outside,... - [Chandler] Jimmy! - and now they're screaming my",
        "8": "name. - [Chris] Jimmy! - Oh my gosh. - [Chan] Hey. - Hey, we got ice cream. - [Jimmy] Did you use\nmy credit card for this? - Of course we did. What, would we use our own money? - Of course. Screw you guys. It just clicked in my head\nthat these goofy, goobers are gonna be try to tempt\nme this entire time. (frozen confection hitting house) They're literally throwing\nice cream at my window. - [Tareq] Oh my God. (strained yelling) (glass window shattering) Did you guys just break the window? - Jimmy! - Jimmy, watch out for the\nbroken glass in",
        "9": "the ice cream. - You guys do realize I'm\nrenting this from a friend? - [Friend] Hey, Jimmy, catch. (frozen confection thudding) Did you guys have fun? - We have one more little trick. - Oh, one more, of course. - We do have one more. - Let me guess you ordered pizza? (background crickets chirping) Okay, get out here. Come on, all you guys go. Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah! The boys smashed a window,... (window glass shattering) and it doesn't seem safe\nto sleep in a house with an open window. I decided to just sleep\nover at a friend's house. It's",
        "10": "the morning. And I woke up with a headache. Doc said it should go\naway within a day or two; it's pretty normal. So yeah, I'm probably\nnot gonna do much today. Despite that I managed to drag\nmyself to the weigh in set, turns out I lost another half a pound. Good progress. Anyways, back to bed\nfor the rest of the day. Today is day five. I'm going to check with the doctor, check on the guy in the circle, film some tik toks, and\nthen figure out how I buy a private island for a\nhundred million subscribers. All right, I weigh 212.2",
        "11": "pounds. I lost another three pounds\nover the last 24 hours. - Where does it go? - Bro, I don't know. - We should find it. - Currently, I'm getting\nblood work done to prove to you guys, and Chris\nthat I haven't eaten. Main thing I'm gonna be\nlooking for is a hormone called leptin. It will tell me whether\nyou're eating, or not. They're gonna take a\ncouple days to come in. - We'll await the results. (electric razor buzzing) - Today is day number six, and for whatever reason,\nI'm feeling really good. I don't wanna get cocky, cause I still have 24 days",
        "12": "left, but I'm starting to think\nthis is actually possible. You guys know the deal, two hundred and ten point one pounds. Well, we're on 210 exactly. Wow. This is Bitcoin this year. And now it's time to go\ncheck on the guy we trapped in the circle. We're filming the hundred\nday in circle video. And after talking really\nloud, for a long time, I'm very tired. So I'm gonna just take a nap, probably. So I did take a nap, in this guy's house, and then we finished filming. Need anything else? - No, I think I'm good. - See you in",
        "13": "a week. - A week. It's currently midnight, and\nthe boys asked if I wanted to hang out. They're all just nomin' away. I'm not gonna lie, in this\nmoment I am contemplating shaving my head so I can eat some nachos. Those look really good. - You can have them. (suspenseful background tune trilling) - All right, I'm sticking to my water. - Your loss. - [Videographer] Good\nmorning, Jim. How you doing? - I'm doing phenomenal, because it's officially been\na week since I ate food. And what better way to\ncelebrate this milestone than some ice balls? (ice spheres clattering) (noisy ice",

(ice cracking in sink) This next shot is brought\nto you from the side, because Tareq didn't hit record. Oh my gosh, I'm down almost\n12 pounds since we started in only a week. Day seven was really busy. First, I did my vital check at the studio. (plastic packaging crackling) - [Studio Worker] Bad, bad, no. - Who left these laying around? I want it so bad. - [Studio Worker] Don't. - You eat it for me. Let me just watch you eat",
        "15": "this Oreo. This is sensational. (background audience groaning) Then I checked out some in progress sets from an upcoming video. And finally, me and Carl\nfilmed with Quackity for the rest of the day. - Well, I don't understand how\nthis constitutes as a talent. - Mental toughness is a challenge. I have ate food in seven days. - What? - [Jimmy] This challenge\nis definitely starting to wear me down. So, um,... (distant vehicle engine roaring) For one of our coming up videos we're... (diesel engine roaring) Thank you, truck. What I was trying to say, is the chocolate factory\nset was being",
        "16": "built, and I wanted to show you. This is a chocolate fountain, and that's how much chocolate\nit requires to fill it. Bro, being around these candies\nare making me so hungry. Why did we have to film\nthis during my fast? The boys sent me a random DM saying, they're playing basketball. It's probably a horrible\nidea, but screw it. I literally air balled my first shot. - [Nolan] He's definitely\na lot less energetic, making less shots. I didn't realize how weak\nI was from not eating. But despite that, I still\nmanaged to score a little. (Jimmy excited cheering) So funny story, I just",
        "17": "pooped, and that's significant, because this was my first\npoop in over a week. So I did some Googling, and apparently this is a normal thing. Not gonna lie, it, it feels so weird to poop again. I was recording some videos\nfor the reaction channel, and it really just, it drained me, man. - It's almost Jimmy James nap time. He is low on calories. - I'm, I'm low on the energies. I also just didn't sleep\nthat well last night, but I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm on a couch in the studio, and I'm literally just sleeping. (background",
        "18": "windows\ncomputer tonal chiming) On day 10 I flew out to New York, to meet with Mark Rover. Me and mark are about the\ntalk on the stage in front of a bunch of very important people. And I'm tired, and haven't ate food. - I didn't know was\nscientifically possible to survive that long without food. - [Jimmy] But back home, the\nboys had their own plans. - While Jimmy's in New York, Tareq let us into his house, and we've been filling\nit with food all day. - I've been eating all day. - Stop. - Okay. - [Mark] We removed\nthirty-two and a",

Stop!\nYou're making it splosh. - [Jimmy] I recently\nlaunched a chocolate brand, and I thought it would be\nfun to give you guys all some chocolate bars. (show audience cheering) (background rock tune riffing) - The talk went great, and now I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. - When Jimmy gets back\nfrom New York, guys, he's not gonna know what\nhit him, but it was us. He's definitely gonna eat, and then we get to shave his head. - Team",

What is this? - Ya hungry? - Yes, actually. My stomach pain went\naway for the most part, but now it's throbbing. - [Chandler] Did you check\nunder the toilet seats? (background techno tune blaring) - No, and because you said\nthat I'm not",

And the day only got worse from there. I was so nauseous that I couldn't film for more than 20 minutes without\nsitting down for a break. Oh my God, I'm gonna throw up. At one point, I almost scrapped the chocolate factory video,\nbecause I was so low energy. - [Videographer] You want\nto sit down for a second? (Jimmy fatigued groaning) And by the end of the day, I\nfelt like I",
        "22": "was gonna pass out. So we headed to check with the doctor. (background show tune blaring) I'm getting pretty low on energy. So I'm gonna talk to the doctor, and see what we should do. - I think we should shave your head. And then you can eat, and\nthen you'll feel better. - True, it is actually\nkind of tempting right now. I really am hungry. - Your hormone levels came back, and it shows you are\ndoing good with your fast. - I believe you. I saw you sleep eight times today. - It's definitely starting\nto catch up to me. -",

When you start to feel worse, we can always break the fast for your... - Uhhh... - safety. - Yeah, we can break the\nhair off of your head too. - And this is why you\nneed medical supervision when you do these long fast. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm listening to him. - [Videographer] Good night, man. We'll see you on chocolate\nfactory tomorrow.

I would not like peanuts. 50 minutes past midnight, so it's actually officially day 14. It has been two weeks,\nsince I last day food, our hotel room had a\nbunch of snacks in it, and Nolan won't stop\neating them in front of me. - All I know how to do is eat chips. - Tomorrow we're gonna be\ncooking food for",

We just filmed with Gordon\nRamsey from one of our videos. He has informed me, he\nwants to cook me something for his channel. - But you can't eat. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. As far as YouTube channel,\nCarl can taste test for me. You know, it's how he's\none of the greatest chefs to ever live, and by not\neating it I'd be passing up a golden opportunity. - Welcome to",

(background ethereal chiming) - [Gordon] It's supposed to\nbe sloppy, rich, delicious... - [Jimmy] I love it, I love it. It's the best thing I've ever tasted... in my life.

Okay, just let me see\nthat side real quick. Look how thin the side of my head is. I, all right, you know what? I'm ending the video here. I didn't trust Chris\nwith the razor anymore, so this is my barber finishing up. And this is the only\ntime you're gonna see me like this. For the next five months,\nI'm gonna be wearing a hat.
