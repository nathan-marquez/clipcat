        "0": "- We're about to test things that nobody has ever done before, like flattening a Lamborghini\nwith a hydraulic press, climbing a building with\na real Spider-Man suit, the world's largest elephant\ntoothpaste experiment, filling a pool with 1\nbillion Orbeez and more. And to kick things off, we're gonna see if that brick wall can stop this train. This wall is 20 feet tall\nand three feet thick. It's not going down easy. Give the orders. - Large cheese. - I hate you. Send the train. - Train us! The train's coming! - Will the brick wall stop the train? Oh my God! My",
        "1": "gosh! So the brick wall might\nnot have stopped it, but later in this video, we're gonna see if five semi trucks can. But for this next experiment,\nI bought this car, built a giant ramp, and we're gonna see how\nmany buses it can jump over. How many buses will it jump? At least three.\n- Four! - I think it's gonna jump\nall 12 and go into the woods. It's coming, it's coming-\n- Okay. - It went through a bus, holy crap! - This looks like some\nFast & Furious stuff. - Now let's do it, but with the jet engines. I may have",
        "2": "forgotten to mention that. The first car was just for reference. This is the real experiment. Here it comes. Here it comes, oh, it's going way faster. It literally knocked a bus over. It's in the side of the bus! - How does it keep doing that? - Hey Jimmy? - Yeah. - You can't park here. - For our next experiment\nwe have 1 billion Orbeez! - That's a lot. - We're gonna drop Tareq's\ncar from this helicopter to see if the Orbeez can cushion the fall. The only problem is, we\nhaven't told him yet. Can I borrow that camera\nreal",
        "3": "quick, Tareq? What do you think that is over there? - Yo, that's my car! Wait, that's my car! - See this iPad? This is your car in the parking lot . - I literally just parked\nmy car, earlier today. Minutes later, a helicopter\njust picked it up. - Your car, baby! - Yeah, if I know Jimmy, he's\njust gonna lower it nicely. - Oh, really?\n- It'd be fine. - Move it higher, move it higher. - This is crazy! - Keep going, a little higher. Right about there, that's good. - Three, two, one! - No, no, no, no, hold",
        "4": "on! - Drop the car! - Now, that was sick! - Bro, that was a perfect landing. That was better than me,\nparallel parking that car. - Now let's see if Tareq's car survived. Open the floodgates. Chris, no, come back! There's a car in there! - There's my car, it's destroyed! - Hey, tell your bumper to watch out! It almost bumped into me. - No, no, no, no, my baby. - There you go, it should be fine. You don't even really need this part. - This is wild . - The best part is, that wasn't even Tareq's",
        "5": "car. We picked up his car from\nthe parking lot, dropped it in the middle of a random field, picked up a perfect replica of his car and then, dropped that in the Orbeez. - What is happening? This is not my car, actually? - No, it's a replica of your car. Your car is in the field over there. - I don't like you right now. - And now, we're back at the train and we're gonna see if these\nsemi trucks could stop it. These semi trucks are massive. They're so big that I echo\nif I talk in that direction.",
        "6": "Raise your hand if you\nthink the train will win. - Me.\n- Me. - I have faith in the truck. We also made crash test dummies with the boys to see what\nwould happen to them. - All right, Chandler's is secure. - Do you think you'll survive? - Oh, I don't know, Jim. - Send the train! - Train, train, train, train, train. - Jimmy, the train is coming! It's coming! - So Tareq, make sure you\nget that angle for us. There it is. Oh my God! Wait, all right, it might stop it. It might stop it! Oh my gosh,",
        "7": "no, it snapped it in half! All that remains is train. The train tore through the semi trucks and could drag these for a couple more miles if\nwe wanted to, ripped 'em. - Oh no, my boy, my boy. What's happened to him? - Gosh, the arm's gone. - Well, at least you're still attached. - Let me see if the head's over here. He's right here, boys. - Verdict? - Train won.\n- Train won. - Everyone agrees, the train won. Hello Neighbor 2 just came out and to celebrate, I built a\nscaled replica of their house in real life.",
        "8": "And we're gonna see what\nhappens if it gets hit by a meteor. And I made realistic-looking mannequins of each of the boys, because I wanted to find\nthe best place to hide to survive a meteor hitting your house. You can put your mannequins\nanywhere in the house you want. Try to survive the\nmeteor crash, come on in. - Hello, neighbor! - That's not real. - It's so hard to get\nthis body in my trunk. I think he'll be safe now. - Are you hiding him on the couch? - The pillow's gonna cushion\nthe fall from the meteor. It has to work.",
        "9": "- You're telling me if a meteor's hurling at your house, you're gonna hide up there. - It's gonna miss this section. - I'll be driving. - Let's see how many of the boys survive? Drop the meteor! - Oh, here it comes. - Oh! - That was only one of three meteors. Somehow, Karl didn't fall. This is what it looks like\nif a meteor hits your house. Let's drop the next one. And while we're waiting for them to raise the next meteor,\nI wanna tell you guys about Hello Neighbor 2. It's an atmospheric stealth horror game about digging",
        "10": "up your\ncreepy neighbor's secrets. - That sounds scary. - In this video game,\nyou investigate a series of missing person cases in the\nopen world of Raven Brooks. But trust no one, boys, everyone\nin the game is a suspect. - Trust no one. - Not even Nolan. - Yeah, we have meteor number two, but this time, the meteor's on fire. Drop the meteor! - My car! Hello Neighbor 2 is available right now on PC, Xbox, Switch and\nPlayStation Consoles. Oh my God! - You're definitely deceased. The meteor's still smoking. - Wait a minute, I'm okay! - Somehow, Chris survived. -",
        "11": "I am smart. We survived, buddy. - Chandler, on the other\nhand, didn't make it. - Raise the last meteor. Chandler, you're now me. - I'm rich. - Drop the meteor when you want. - Drop the meteor! - Oh, okay. - Oh my goodness! - Goodbye, Karl. - Let's see if I survived. Yes! Click the link in the description to go to Hello Neighbor\n2's official website and buy the game right now. - And now you know where to\nhide if a meteor's coming at our house, you're welcome. For our next experiment,\nif you take this chemical and mix it",
        "12": "with that chemical... You get elephant foam toothpaste. In these containers, is 100\ntimes, what we just did. Hey, don't touch that bucket! Back up. I need you all to find a safe spot because this next explosion\nis 100 times bigger. - Standing right here. - At least I'll be safe on the roof. - Dibs on roof. Wait, Jimmy, did we get all the elephants, so we can clean their\nteeth with this toothpaste? - You're funny. When you pull, Chandler, you need to run. - I'm 100% in the danger zone. - Pull! Oh my God! Keep pulling! Pull harder!",
        "13": "Oh God. - Look at it go! It filled the entire pool! It looks like the pool's on fire. - And that, is the new world record for elephant foam toothpaste. - Oh, it's steamy. I wanna jump in it so bad. It's the forbidden swimming pool now. - We're officially cooler than Mark Rober. - Yeah, and so is the entire\npopulation of the Earth. - You know what's cooler than this? - Nolan's mom. - You know what's cooler than Nolan's mom? - What?\n- Next experiment. - This is Dave, a professional\nSpider-Man stunt double. This is a working Spider-Man",
        "14": "suit, and he's gonna climb\nthis entire building, go! - Congratulations, your one foot up. Are your spidey-senses tingling yet? - Tingling like crazy. - This Spider-Man suit\nwas made by J. Laser and the highest he's climbed\nwith it, was 200 feet. Dave's gonna climb 200 feet and then climb 200 feet again,\nup this massive skyscraper. - This is nuts. - He's right there. - Wait, he's actually right there. - Are you taking a picture? I want a picture. - I don't know how far I am. I'm not gonna stop til I'm finished. - He's literally outside the\nbuilding window right",
        "15": "now. Hey! Hey! - You're halfway there. - Sounded like they said halfway. This is insane. - Starting to rain a bit. Rain's really coming down now. Come on. - Whoa, wait, does his suit stop working? - Dave, do you want us to let you down? - I'm good. I've been the real Spider-Man many times and I don't give up. Spidey never gives up. - It looks like he got it working again. How's he doing this? - I gonna keep climbing. This thing ain't over til I'm at the top. I'm high. - Just looking over the",
        "16": "ledge\nto see him, terrifies me. There's a reason this guy\nstunt doubles for Spider-Man. He's almost there! Dave, you're a monster, 400 feet. Dave, you are insane. Oh, he did it! Here's $10,000. - Holy crap. - You deserve this. When's the next Spider-Man movie? - I can't say. - All right, he's better than Tom Holland. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, hydraulic press.\n- Hurry up, Jimmy! It's too heavy! - Can you guys move out the way? - Oh yeah, sorry.\n- Yeah, sure. - Versus the Lamborghini. Let's see how flat it can get. And just",
        "17": "like throughout this video, the boys are gonna see if\ntheir mannequins can survive. - This is how you deal\nwith your school bullies. - The hood is the safest spot in a car. - I'll guard you, Karl. - Get to crushing! - Let's go, baby! - All right, well, Chandler's gone. - I'm still okay. - Oh snap. Oh my God. Wow, all the windows! - Yes! - Oh my gosh. - The tires are collapsing. - Wow, this is crazy. In case you were wondering, that Lamborghini doesn't work anymore. - Definitely doesn't work now. - I thought it",
        "18": "would\nsquish it into a pancake. So to make it up to you,\nlet's blow up the Lamborghini. - Explosion! \u266a MrBeast, oh \u266a \u266a Mr \u266a - Hey, I feel like those\nguys who farm cranberries."

    "summary": "The video showcases extreme experiments, such as flattening a Lamborghini, building jumps over buses, dropping cars from helicopters, and testing if a brick wall can stop a train. They include dropping meteors on a house replica, climbing a building in a Spider-Man suit, and creating a massive elephant toothpaste explosion.",
    "scene_captions": {
        "8": "In the image, there is a man in the foreground on the right side wearing a cap and a gray hoodie; he appears to be speaking or gesturing to the camera. In the background, there's a large, unconventional vehicle with black and yellow caution markings. Two individuals are standing below the elevated cabin of that vehicle. On its left, there's an open space where you can see part of a red sports car. It's night time, and the scene is artificially lit. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly in a grassy area.",
        "4": "The image features four individuals in what appears to be an indoor setting. Two of the individuals are real people, while the other two appear to be life-sized dolls or mannequins. The two real people are standing\u2014one on the left in a black hoodie with yellow text and the other on the right wearing a white shirt with the name \"CHANDLER\" on it. They both have brown hair and are smiling and interacting with the mannequins as if they are part of the group. The mannequin on the left is wearing a blue T-shirt with \"NOLAN\" written across it, and the one on the right is also wearing a blue T-shirt with a blurred text that might be a name or other identifier. The setting includes what looks like a wooden structure with stairs in the background that gives a casual, perhaps residential context to the scene. The image has a humorous or playful tone, with the real individuals seemingly enjoying a moment with the mannequins.",
        "5": "The image appears to be digitally altered. It shows a house on fire in the background, and superimposed in front of it are various gaming consoles and accessories. From left to right, there's a Nintendo Switch, a gaming PC tower, a PlayStation 5 console with its controller, and an Xbox Series X console with its controller. The juxtaposition of these items with the burning house could imply a commentary or meme about video gaming culture, but without additional context, the specific intent behind this image is unclear.",
        "7": "The image shows an individual scaling a tall building, using what appears to be climbing gear or their bare hands. There is a marking on the image providing a height reference of 161 ft, suggesting that the person is at that height above the ground. The structure is modern, covered with large glass windows and framed by concrete or metal. The view indicates that this is an urban environment, as other buildings can be seen below. The act depicted is potentially dangerous and not something that should be attempted without proper training and safety measures. The image is likely taken from a drone or another building.",
        "6": "In the image, there is an empty swimming pool with its surface covered in what appears to be a light blue tarp or a special coating. The pool is not filled with water. There are several people around the pool who appear to be engaged in some activity.\n\nIn the foreground, a person is sitting on the edge of the pool, holding onto a rope that is attached to a sledge-like object on the tarp-covered pool surface. The sledge is covered in red foliage or soft material, perhaps replicating a sledding experience. There seems to be a camera mounted on a tripod beside this person, likely recording the activity.\n\nIn the background, another person is running towards the pool edge and appears to be jumping onto a different sledge that is also on the tarp. \n\nAdjacent to the pool area, there's a blue wall with some decoration, and the overall environment suggests that this might be a recreational activity or experiment of some sort. The activity seems playful and possibly part of a challenge or game being recorded for entertainment purposes.",
        "2": "The image shows an aerial view of a landscape with various elements. In the center, there is a construction site with a circular structure that appears to be brightly colored, alongside a cleared area with construction materials and equipment. To the left of the construction site, there is a long, straight road flanked by trees, and beyond that, a rural setting with fields, forests, and what appear to be residential buildings. To the upper right corner, there's a small aircraft flying with a trailing banner. The landscape suggests a countryside or suburban region. The weather is clear, and it seems to be daytime.",
        "3": "The image features an individual standing outdoors beside a row of large white trailer units. The person is wearing a blue shirt, a baseball cap, and what appears to be jeans. In the foreground, there's text that reads \"IF I TALK,\" likely a part of a sentence or statement as part of a video or caption. The setting looks to be a commercial or industrial area, given the trailers and the open space that suggests a storage or transport facility. The sky is clear and blue, indicating fair weather.",
        "1": "This is a photo of three individuals posing together. The person on the left is wearing sunglasses and a white T-shirt with a graphic design, the middle individual has a hat and a dark green hoodie on, and the person on the right is wearing a black shirt. They appear to be in front of a red overturned vehicle that's behind a yellow school bus, indicating that they might be at some sort of event or location with a focus on outdoor or possibly extreme activities. It's sunny, and everyone seems to be in a casual and friendly mood.",
        "0": "The image is blurry and unclear, but it appears to show a red sports car in motion. Due to the motion blur, specific details such as the make and model are not discernible. The car's design suggests it could be a high-performance vehicle, possibly from a luxury or sport-oriented manufacturer."
